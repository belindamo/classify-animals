# Literature Review

## Summary

The field of automated animal classification has experienced rapid evolution driven by advances in deep learning and computer vision. Current research reveals a diverse landscape of approaches addressing various challenges in wildlife monitoring, from traditional CNN architectures to cutting-edge Vision Transformers. A critical assumption spanning the literature is that standard computer vision models can be directly applied to wildlife domains, yet recent work demonstrates that domain-specific adaptations and considerations are essential for practical deployment.

The literature reveals three primary research directions: (1) architectural innovations focusing on accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, (2) specialized applications addressing real-world deployment constraints, and (3) technical challenges including out-of-distribution detection and domain adaptation. A recurring theme across papers is the tension between model performance and computational feasibility for edge deployment in resource-constrained environments.

## Research Gaps

### Critical Literature-Level Assumptions to Challenge

**Assumption 1: Direct Visual Classification Sufficiency**
The literature predominantly assumes that direct visual evidence (animal appearances) provides sufficient information for comprehensive wildlife monitoring. However, AnimalClue's work on indirect evidence suggests this assumption may limit monitoring effectiveness.

**Proposed Flip**: Comprehensive animal classification systems should integrate multiple evidence types (visual, audio, indirect traces) for robust species identification and behavioral understanding.

**Assumption 2: Closed-World Classification Adequacy** 
Most animal classification research operates under closed-world assumptions, assuming all encountered species are within the training set. Muthivhi et al.'s OOD work reveals this assumption creates safety risks in real deployments.

**Proposed Flip**: Animal classification systems must be designed for open-world scenarios with explicit unknown class handling and confidence calibration.

**Assumption 3: Computational Resource Availability**
Many high-performance approaches (Vision Transformers achieving 99% accuracy) assume adequate computational resources, conflicting with deployment realities in remote wildlife monitoring locations.

**Proposed Flip**: Model architecture selection should prioritize deployability and efficiency metrics alongside accuracy, with explicit resource-constrained optimization.

### Specific Research Gaps

1. **Standardized Evaluation Protocols**: Lack of consistent benchmarking across wildlife monitoring applications prevents meaningful comparison of approaches.

2. **Long-term Adaptation**: Limited research on how animal classification models adapt to seasonal changes, aging, and long-term environmental shifts.

3. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Insufficient investigation of optimal human-in-the-loop systems for wildlife monitoring, particularly for expert knowledge integration.

4. **Cross-Species Transfer Learning**: Most work focuses on specific species sets without investigating transfer learning across taxonomically diverse groups.

5. **Ethical and Privacy Considerations**: Limited discussion of ethical implications and privacy concerns in comprehensive wildlife monitoring systems.

### Implications for Animal Classification Research

The literature reveals that effective animal classification requires moving beyond traditional computer vision approaches toward domain-aware, resource-conscious, and multi-modal systems. The field would benefit from research that explicitly challenges the assumptions of closed-world operation, direct visual sufficiency, and resource abundance that permeate current work.
